## :large_blue_circle: More Projects
:small_blue_diamond: *DS_AutoMPG* is an analysis of the well known AutoMPG dataset using the low code platform Orange3.

:small_blue_diamond:  *DS_classifier_comparo_gh* is a comparison of three classifiers: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and kNN. These three classifiers are applied to the AutoMPG dataset which has been repurposed as a classification dataset by introducing a new categorical target variable.
